      A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] ⓘ) is a French pastry made
      from puff pastry in a crescent shape.[1] It is a buttery, flaky,
      viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but
      using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[2] Croissants are named
      for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter,
      rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
      sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
      flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been
      made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since
      antiquity.[3] The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century
      when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
      yeast-leavened laminated dough.[4] In the late 1970s, the development of
      factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast
      food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery,
      notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
      American-style fast food,[5] and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold
      in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.[6]
      Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
      countries and served as dessert all around the world.
